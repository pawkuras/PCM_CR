All algorithms presented in this paper (except SBS algorithm) were implemented using Python 3.6.7 on Google Colab platform without hardware acceleration. External modules used in Python scripts were: scipy, numpy, sympy, itemgetter, csv, random. SBS Algorithm was implemented using R. Also, all algorithm results were verified using R. 4000 matrices was generated in symbolic notation using sympy module and results are present in the decimal notation using rounding from numpy module with precise of 4.
All Python codes were compiled into Windows executable with command interface using pyinstaller module for Python and are available here: https://github.com/pawkuras/PCM_CR 
This repository also contain all results and data used to create this paper. Tool from this repository allow to load matrices from CSV file or to generate new matrices and export it to CSV files.
